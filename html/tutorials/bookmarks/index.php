                <h2>The best bookmark solution I've found (so far).</h2>

                <h3>tl;dr: just put your bookmarks on github</h3>

                <p>Integrated bookmark managers in web browsers like Chrome and
                Firefox suck.</p>

                <p>Wouldn't you rather be able to store your passwords in plain
                text and be able to access them anywhere, on any device
                <em>instantly</em> without having to download "apps" or log into
                a bloated web browser with your Firefox/Google account?</p>

                <h3>Introducing: Soyless Bookmarks</h3>

                <p>You can view all of my bookmarks by visiting
                <a href="https://soyless.xyz/bookmarks">https://soyless.xyz/bookmarks</a>
                which redirects to the gist containing all my bookmarks in plain
                text. Github allows the creation of "secret" gists which are not
                searchable, but are accessible to anyone who has the URL.</p>

                <p>I wrote a
                <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sife-ops/dotfiles/master/.local/bin/bookmarks.sh">program</a>
                for dmenu and fzf that automatically downloads your bookmarks
                gist and enables you to quickly search, open, and edit the URLs.
                To use the edit bookmarks feature, you will need to install
                github-cli and generate a
                <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">personal access token</a>
                for Github.<p>

                ~/.config/bookmarks/config: <br>
                <div class="code" >
                    BOOKMARKS="&lt;path to local bookmarks file&gt;" <br>
                    BOOKMARKS_GIST="&lt;link to your raw gist&gt;" <br>
                    BOOKMARKS_TOKEN="&lt;path to encrypted token&gt;"
                </div>

                <p>I highly recommend storing account credentials (API tokens,
                IRC login passwords, etc.) for programs in a GPG encrypted files
                rather than plain text config files, so put your github token in
                a temp file with user-only permissions and ecrypt it with
                gpg:<p>

                <div class="code" >
                    $ token=$(mktemp /tmp/token.XXX) <br>
                    $ chmod 600 "$token" <br>
                    $ printf "&lt;your github token&gt;" &gt; "$token" <br>
                    $ gpg --recipient &lt;your GPG ID&gt; --output &lt;path to encrypted token&gt; --encrypt "$token"
                </div>

                <p>And that's it!</p>

                <p>The next tutorial will probably be about how I manage my
                bookmarks in a similar way</p>
