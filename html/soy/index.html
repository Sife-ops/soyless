                <h2>The Soydev Cargo Cult</h2>

                <h2>What is soy?</h2>
                <p>
                Soy is perpetuated by NPCs and bugmen.  If you are one of those,
                turn off this website right now.  Soy is defined as programs
                that are popular.  It is a common moral lesson to teach that
                popular does not equal good.  But does that mean popular equals
                bad?
                </p>

                <p >
                Yes.
                </p>

                <p >
                Soyftware is a slippery slope that you should avoid at all
                costs.  Anyone who tells you otherwise should not trusted.

                The most common popular programs are always the worst nowdays.
                Here are some good examples:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Anything that calls itself an "app"</li>
                    <li>Flatpaks and Snaps</li>
                    <li>"Code editors"</li>
                    <li>Microsoft Word</li>
                    <li>Libre Office</li>
                    <li>All other word processors</li>
                    <li>Chromium</li>
                    <li>Firefox</li>
                    <li>Syncthing</li>
                    <li>Javascript</li>
                    <li>Windows 10</li>
                    <li>MacOS</li>
                    <li>Android</li>
                    <li>IOS, etc</li>
                </ul>

                <p >
                We understand that people who use soyftware do so because they
                don't know any better.  If you are one those people and want to
                learn more about better programs, check <a

                <h2>What is a soydev?</h2>
                <p >
                People who make bloated soyftware that is slow.  Their soyftware
                doesn't solve any problem that wasn't already solved by a much
                simpler faster program.  Soydevs reinvent the wheel to impress
                themselves and fellow soydevs...  except the new wheel sucks
                more.

                    The Silicon Valley/ Seattle based soy latte drinking hipster
                    you see at the coffee shop, coding NodeJS on his macbook
                    pro. He only uses a bloated IDE and is too beta to ever
                    touch Vim. This creature will justify his use of a macbook
                    by saying that "it's UNIX based" but at the same time will
                    defend not having a linux machine due to some nonsense
                    reason. GUI everything; it makes him feel safe. #1
                    aspiration in life is to work for FAANG and will consume any
                    disgusting product or service they sell.

                <h2>"Code" "Apps"</h2>
                <p>
                You are definitely a soydev if you use the word "code" to refer
                to a programming language.  The origin of the word code to refer
                to programming is the result of the soydev cargo cult.  Real
                programmers don't refer to all programming language as code.
                Soydevs, who are not real programmers, lack the knowledge of
                basic vocabulary words for developing software, so they started
                referring to everything as either "code" or "apps."
